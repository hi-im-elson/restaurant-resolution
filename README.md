# Bottom up market sizing

## The Problem
*How much of our total addressable market does the business currently serve?*

This is a question commonly asked in assessing the success of a business or the attractiveness of an investment. The common approach is to take the total revenue of the business and divide it by the market size as defined by some industry or consulting group to receive your answer.

The limitation of this approach is when you ask "now what?". The effectiveness of this analysis is limited by the degree of granularity offered by the source of market data, often on a national aggregate.

## The Solution

By changing the approach of analysis from a top-down to bottom-up, it is possible to perform more actionable analysis by splitting the revenue and market data down to its most atomic grain, the (potential) customer. 

CRM data will contain each customer as a row of data while the market data can be legal entities (service or B2B), points-of-interests (B2b), or individuals (B2C). Using text similarity algorithms, overlaying the customer data with market data can provide a clear view of which entities are existing customers. This then allows analysis using attributes both from the customer and market datasets to achieve segments and attributes not available as separate datasets.
